# Add dependency modules

---

Reusability is the core of SOMOD. By adding available modules as dependencies, one can import the complete functionality of added modules into the current solution.

## Example:-

Add [somod-http-api-gateway](https://www.npmjs.com/package/somod-http-api-gateway) as a dependency to get the API gateway initialized.

By running `npm install somod-http-api-gateway`, you get the infrastructure code ready for creating api gateway in AWS

## Module Catalog

Browse our [module catalog](/catalog) to find out readily available modules. You can add any number of modules from the catalog or your SOMOD modules as dependencies.

In the [Next Chapter](/getting-started/develop/serverless), let us understand how to add a backend code for creating api with persistent storage.
