# Type Definitions in SOMOD

> Typescript type definitions from SOMOD

> DONT INSTALL THIS PACKAGE DIRECTLY. THIS WILL BE PART OF SOMOD

## Usage

SOMOD CLI uses this internally.

These types are re-exported from `somod` package. It is recommended to import these types from `somod` for creating plugins

```typescript
import { Plugin } from "somod";

const myPlugin: Plugin = {
  // ...
};

export default myPlugin;
```
